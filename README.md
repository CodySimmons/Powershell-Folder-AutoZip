# Powershell-Folder-AutoZip
Simple Powershell script to automatically zip folders inside a directory.

Small PowerShell tool used to only zip folders inside of a directory.
Used when not able to access other archival programs that allow individual folder archival inside of a directory.
Will generate an output file, zipOutput.log, to record files and folders zipped.
Does not delete folders after completion, just in case errors occured (such as no space on drive).
